### General info

This project is a simple note taking app inspired by the [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/).

I learned in [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) how to create the Add and Delete notes functionality for this app in React.

In order to deepen my knowledge on the technologies learned in the course, I decided to create a fullstack application with Create, Read, Update and Delete functionalities.
